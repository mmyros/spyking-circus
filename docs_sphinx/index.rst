The SpyKING CIRCUS is a massively parallel code to perform semi automatic spike sorting on large extra-cellular recordings. Using a smart clustering and a greedy template matching approach, the code can solve the problem of overlapping spikes, and has been tested both for *in vitro* and *in vivo* data, from tens of channels to up to 4225 channels. Results are very good, cross-validated on several datasets, and details of the algorithm can be found in the following publication: http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/04/067843

.. warning::
   
   We strongly recommend to upgrade to 0.6, as a rare but annoying bug has been found in 0.5.xx while exporting value for post-processing GUIs (MATLAB, phy). The bug is not systematic, depending on the numbers of templates/cores, but it is worth upgrading. A patch will be automatically applied to already sorted results while launching the GUIs, but for phy users, you will need to relaunch the ``converting`` step
